## 🧪 Testing Note

Unit and integration tests were **not implemented** in this version of the project.

### Why?

- The assignment did not explicitly require tests.
- I prioritized building clean, modular, and well-documented business logic first.
- I also wanted to ensure that the core APIs, rule parsing, and edge-case handling were fully functional end-to-end.

### Future Plan

I am eager to add:
- ✅ JUnit 5 + Mockito test coverage for `RuleEngineService`
- ✅ Validation tests for edge cases and exceptions
- ✅ Integration test cases for controller endpoints using `MockMvc`

Testing is an area I have actively started exploring and excited to improve upon.

---

## 🧠 Reflection and Rationale

### 🔧 a. Design Choices

#### i. Why This Design?

- **Rule Matching**: I used a `List<PromotionRule>` and iterated it using traditional loops. This ensured clarity, control, and performance for an in-memory system.
- **DTO Usage**: DTOs (`PlayerRequest`, `PromotionPayload`, `MetricsResponse`) were used to separate internal logic from API contracts, ensuring clean and maintainable code.
- **Modular Services**: Interfaces and implementations were separated (e.g., `RuleEngineServiceImpl`) to follow the SOLID principles and allow future extensibility.
- **YAML for Rules**: YAML was chosen as it’s easy to read/write for non-developers like product managers.
- **Enum Usage**: The `SpendTier` enum was added to prevent typos and standardize input.

#### ii. Alternatives Considered

- Considered using Java Stream APIs for filtering rules but avoided it to maintain clarity and because I’m still gaining fluency with streams.
- Considered using a database for rules instead of YAML, but the assignment required in-memory usage.

---

### ⚖️ b. Trade-offs

- **Simplicity vs Performance**: Opted for simple loops over more optimized data structures (like Maps or Trees) to keep the logic accessible and easy to debug.
- **Stateless vs Stateful**: Metrics are kept in memory using atomic counters—lightweight but not persistent.
- **No DB Persistence**: Faster startup and easier testing, but not ideal if you needed auditability or long-term storage.

---

### ❓ c. Areas of Uncertainty

- **Multiple Matches**: Unsure if all matching rules should be returned or just the first. I stuck to first-match logic but introduced a `priority` field for extensibility.
- **Suggestion Granularity**: I kept suggestion logic simple and rule-based rather than scoring or ML-based due to time and clarity constraints.
- **Validation Handling**: Chose to return structured error responses for validation but left out full i18n or field-specific messaging for brevity.

---

### 🤖 d. AI Assistance Disclosure

During the development of this project, AI tools such as **ChatGPT** were used for the following purposes:
- Drafting README sections and markdown formatting
- Generating sample `rules.yaml` data and mock player input requests
- Suggesting architectural improvements
- Explaining trade-offs (e.g., between time window checking vs performance)
- Clarifying backend concepts like A/B testing, time windows, and enum deserialization
- Suggesting best practices for error handling and code modularity
- Providing suggestions for improvement and extensibility
All business logic, service wiring, exception handling, and debugging were implemented manually in IntelliJ. 
AI was used as a learning and productivity assistant, not a code generator.

---

## 🚀 Future Enhancements

- 🔝 Rule prioritization logic (e.g., highest priority wins)
- ➕ Add new rule via admin POST endpoint
- 🧪 Add basic test coverage (JUnit + Mockito)
- 🐳 Dockerize for container-based deployment
- 📷 Add Swagger screenshots in README
- 📊 Promotion analytics/logging
- ⚡ Caching and lookup optimization for large rule sets
